The faculty have earned several National and International distinctions in terms of fellowships and awards. It is one of the most vibrant and visible Departments among the Indian Universities, be that in terms of its location, the competition for admission to the M.Sc Programme, student to faculty ratio, teaching experience of the faculty, publications, extra mural research grants/ support the faculty generates from National and International Organizations, and in terms of infrastructural facilities. In addition, the faculties are able to forge collaboration in the new and interdisciplinary research areas such as Nanobiology, Medical Biotechnology, and Systems Biology etc. On an average 40-50% of our students are qualified in their first attempt of national entrance examinations conducted by CSIR, UGC, ICMR, etc., for research fellowships and for higher studies abroad. The Department attracts several distinguished scientists/ researchers from abroad who are ready to lecture or give seminars on cutting edge research areas in modern Biology.\n', 'M.Sc. Biochemistry: Students admitted to M.Sc have to carry out a course work of 4 semesters that include various courses: Intermediary Metabolism-1, Biophysical Chemistry, Computer Applications in Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (I semester), Intermediary Metabolism II, Enzymology, Molecular Biology I, Structural biology (II Semester), Basic Immunology, Molecular Biology II, Bioenergetics and Biomembranes (III Semester), Nutritional and Clinical Biochemistry (IV Semester). In addition, the Department also offers elective courses such as Endocrine Biochemistry, Biostatistics, Neurochemistry, Molecular Virology, Genomics and Proteomics (III semester) and Immunochemistry, Protein Phosphorylation and Signal Transduction, Genetic disorders, Protein-DNA interactions (IV Semester). In the first three semesters the students have a lab course on Biochemical techniques and have to carry out a project work in the second year (in the III and IV Semesters) that has to be defended before the Departmental Faculty. M.Sc examinations include three internal tests and a final test in each of the courses. While attendance of 75% is a must in each course, successful completion requires a minimum of 40% marks finally in each course.\n\nPh.D. Biochemistry: Successful completion of Ph.D requires the students have to clear the course work of 12 credits, attend and participate in the journal club meetings, submit half yearly research reports before the doctoral committee members and have to submit the research work that requires to be defended in the presence of Departmental and School Faculty in the form of a pre Ph.D seminar prior to submission of their thesis. After submission of thesis and on receipt of the reports from external examiners, the candidate has to also defend his/her thesis after the reports before an external examiner.

Many residents were starting to move out of the city and into the surrounding suburbs at a rate faster than any other American city except for Detroit. Downtown hotels, offices and department stores would close in the 60s and 70s, relocating to the suburbs to chase these residents. As the downtown core emptied out, planners became fixated on providing amenities to attract suburban drivers: wider roads, a more efficient way into and out of the city via I-95 (built 1957-65), and many, many parking lots. It was a tremendous amount of change – even trauma – in such a short period of time, and its impacts fell especially acutely on neighborhoods and residents of color.\r\n\r\nThe Providence Album, Vol 1 revisits Providence in the 1960s through the photographs of Carmel Vitullo and Harry Callahan, whose powerful images capture the city during this time of tremendous change.\r\n\r\nVitullo, who is now 94 and still lives in Providence, documented Federal Hill during this period; her photographs are a love letter to the neighborhood in which she grew up, revealing its vibrant street life and inimitable characters. Callahan moved from Chicago to Providence in 1961 to found RISD’s photography department. Already a well-known experimental photographer then, Callahan would go on to become one of the most significant photographers of the 20th century. While he lived in Providence, he photographed what was close by; his images of downtown are like the stills of a film noir movie, showing dark and deserted streets, surreal window displays, and well-dressed white women in heels who recall the heroines of Alfred Hitchcock movies.\r\n\r\nIf photographs are a way of telling stories, the stories that Vitullo and Callahan were telling about Providence were very different, with contrasting narratives about modern urban life, the role of advertising in the public space of the street, and postwar female identity.\r\n\r\nMarisa Angell Brown, Assistant Director of Programs at the Center for Public Humanities, curated the exhibition with Yilin (Elaine) Huang MA ’20, Yao-Hsuan (Sharon) Lin MA ’20, Dashiell Wasserman PhD ’20 and Ariana Wescott MA ’20, all graduate students in the Public Humanities Master’s program. The exhibition includes audio recordings of interviews that Lin conducted with Vitullo, Stephan Brigidi (one of Callahan’s early students), and long-time Providence residents who reminisce about the spaces in these photographs and the city in the 1960s.
